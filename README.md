Battleships for Web
================= 

[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) Week 3 Project - Pair programmed with [Costas](https://github.com/costassarris).

In this project we had to improve on our first battleships game which we tried to implement for the terminal. 
 
The aim of this project was to put the game we built last week into the browser using Sinatra. Seeing as most of the cohort had not quite got the back-end game working properly, we borrowed Steve's code so that we could learn how to put it on the web. For testing features we used capybara and cucumber.

###Technologies Used
